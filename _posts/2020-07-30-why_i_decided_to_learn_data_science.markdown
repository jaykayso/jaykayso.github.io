Hey you! My name is Jaklyn, but you can call me Jax.

I'm 26 years old and live in Houston, Texas. 

In 2016, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a bachelor's in Anthropology and a minor in Business Administration. Like many people, I didn't really know what I wanted to do, but I wasn't too worried, because I had a willingness to work hard for what I wanted. 

As I set out to make my name in the world, I found a few things to be true: 

* I was more motivated than my coworkers to create a compelling workplace and to perform; I've always had a real zeal for life and I didn't understand people that were content with settling for less than they were capable of. 
 
* I was discouraged by working in spaces where there was a lack of innovation and where outdated systems prevailed simply because it was protocol. Additionally, I considered this detrimental to the employees at the company because part of the value gained in working in a company is industry experience that you hold on to regardless of where you work. Having systems and technology that was outdated made the employees' experience less valuable compared to having experience working with modern, innovative, solutions. 

*  I was frustrated to work in places where I was given lots of responsibility but was not adequately compensated for it compared to other positions at other companies.

* I was also frustrated by not being given promotions and title changes by doing work outside of my job description and constantly exceeding the expectations of my superiors. 

* AND I was frustrated by the realization that if I were running the show I would be willing to do more for the people that worked for me and for the company I was working for. This led me to have a general malaise with management in many places where I worked. 

I guess you could say that as a strong leader and problem solver I started to have feelings that challenged management, titles, and compensation. 

Some companies would encourage being challenged by new and or lower level employees to innovate and strive for improvement. After all, it is new employees that are seeing the company with the freshest of eyes.

I believe that it is so important for companies to craft the employee experience through excellent management tactics because an employer plays a big role in the life of a person. Many of us spend more time with coworkers at work than we do with our own families. Having a great work place can really affect the quality of your life! 

So from 2016 to 2019 I stumbled through my fair share of jobs that didn't cut it for me. 

I really started asking the hard questions: 

What does a good life look like to me? 

What do I need to be happy? 

Do I want to work full time for 40 years and finally enjoy the fruits of my labor when I am old and gray? 

How can I structure my life to be more of what I want and less of what I don't want? 

Sometimes this can be intimidating and scary because sometimes, we don't have options, or at least, we don't see any other options so we don't ask the questions. But if we don't ask the questions and step out into what is unknown, we will never know the answers. 

I knew that it was highly possible that I would run into the same conundrums at new jobs and with other superiors. What I eventually realized though, was that if I focused on what my goals were, I could overlook those. I could make my goals such a priority to me that a burned out coworker or apathetic boss wouldn't phase me. I would build a strategy to eventually escape the rules that were surrounding me rather than placing the professional team goals as my ultimate goals.

Okay so- it was July of 2019: the jobs were sucking, the brain was working, and then I got a call one day while I was at work. 

It was the City of Houston. They told me that my dad passed away and that I was next of kin. The next several months of my life were spent planning a funeral, emptying his home, and organizing his accounts. There were many road bumps along the way including internal family conflict and a legal struggle. I did the vast majority of it alone and definitely learned who my real friends were. Shoutout to my ride-or-dies. 

All of this shook me in a way that was rough, no doubt, but also challenged me to grow exponentially. It caused me to look at my life from different perspectives and really challenge myself to take what I wanted my life to be, and make it a reality.

While I was navigating the management of my late father's estate I cycled through a couple of restaurant jobs. While there were aspects that I really enjoyed, like having real conversations with people, there were also aspects that were less than extraordinary, like serving people who were so far removed from the idea of what it was like to work at a restaurant or what it took to actually serve, and depending on those people to tip me in order to make a living wage. 

I'm not complaining though, because I was making great money and I loved my job. I was working at a laid back, swanky, bar in the River Oaks District of Houston. My coworkers were amazing, and I looked forward to contributing to the team that I was on every day. Everything was going great- until the pandemic happened. 

If I'm being honest I knew that I was selling myself short and not living up to my potential. I knew that I could be solving more compelling problems for the world and that is what I wanted. I wanted to be in rooms of people who were discussing interesting things and improving the lives of others. 

On one hand, it wasn't a big deal right? I was happy and the money was easy- at times, comically so. However, I knew it was dangerous for me to be too comfortable serving. There's this conviction that I carry with me that I have a responsibility to live up to what I am capable of- whatever that is. There's this idea that stays with me, that if I we are striving to be our best selves and to ask the hard questions about what that looks like, then we will be doing the best we can in this world. Of course, it's a little bit about the milestones along the way, but it's a lot about the journey. 

I started learning about data science in February of 2020. The factors that draw me the most are the pay, the possibility of working remote, the challenge of solving complex problems, and the job security. I also like the competitiveness of positions because I'm hoping it will naturally cause me to be on teams with people that care about the work that they do.

In June 2020, when my mom and stepdad visited me at work, which again, was at another restaurant, I made a promise to myself, that the next time my parents visited me at work, it wouldn't be at a restaurant. 

The most valuable thing to me in life, is freedom. Not necessarily the idea of being able to do nothing. The idea of not having to do things that you don't want to do, and having the resources to make your life a little sweeter so that you can actually stop and smell the roses. The idea of being able to pursue projects that you find interesting; pretty much having some wiggle room in life. So when I ask the tough questions mentioned earlier, my answers usually revolve around prioritizing those values.

I place a high value on creating a strategic future by design. I believe it is of the utmost importance to strategically construct your life rather than allowing it to just happen to you. Granted, most of our 'plans' don't turn out the way we were hoping, but I think just to plan them in the first place is crucial. It allows for introspection, especially when we ask, 'if I could do anything I want, what would that be?'

To have a life that allows me to be more in control and relaxed, I have decided to pursue a career that will enable me to make more than enough money. I also love the flexibility of data science to apply to many industries. For instance, if I wanted to invest in a startup and develop a market analysis, I could use my skills, as well as if I wanted to better understand the price trends for homes in my area for the last 6 months. 

At some point, I would like to leverage my data science skills in favor of my own pursuits.

All of that being said, I'll be starting with my online cohort on August 17th and studying 45 hours per week for a 5 month period to kick off my journey in data science. 

I find myself constantly excited about what the future holds and inching closer to living up to my potential. The thing is, I know there will never be a day where I say, "okay I did it. I lived up to my potential" becuase I can always do a little better, and I think that is kind of the point. 

We can always challenge ourselves to meet more of our potential We can figure out how to be a little more present, or more kind, or to really listen, or ito dentify someone that we can encourage. The pursuit of making life great for yourself and others is what I believe makes it worth living, so that is why I decided to learn data science. 


TL;DR I didn't know what I wanted to be and got burned by corporate America. I knew I wasn't living up to my potential working at a restaurant and then my dad died and it made me take action on making changes in my life. I want to make my life awesome and the pursuit of that itself is what is already improving my quality of life.
